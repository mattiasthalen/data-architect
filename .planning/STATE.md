# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-07)

**Core value:** The DAB layer must produce a correct, methodology-compliant Anchor Model through genuine agent debate — system analyst vs. business analyst, architect synthesis, rule validation, user decision — not just template generation.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Foundation)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-07 — Roadmap created with 5 phases covering all 35 v1 requirements

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 5 phases derived from requirements with 100% coverage — Foundation → CLP → Anchor → Generation → Validation
- Phase 1 scope: All orchestration and agent definition requirements (14 total) to establish debate infrastructure before modeling work

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 2 (CLP Workflow):**
- Anchor Modeling conceptual-to-logical translation rules need deeper research — no TypeScript reference implementation exists, must study Java Anchor Modeler

**Phase 3 (Anchor Modeling):**
- Join elimination behavior on target databases needs validation — theory says 6NF optimizers handle it, practice may differ by platform

**Phase 5 (Validation):**
- Nunjucks-Jinja compatibility edge cases for dbt integration need testing with dbt Core execution
