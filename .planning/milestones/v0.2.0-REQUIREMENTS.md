# Requirements: Data Architect

**Defined:** 2026-02-08
**Core Value:** The DAB layer must produce a correct, methodology-compliant Anchor Model through genuine agent debate -- not just template generation.

## v0.2.0 Requirements

Requirements for pre-commit framework migration. Each maps to roadmap phases.

### Pre-commit Framework

- [x] **HOOK-01**: Pre-commit framework installed via `make bootstrap` — Makefile line 11: `uv run pre-commit install`
- [x] **HOOK-02**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` exists with a `local` hook that runs `make check` — config line 10: `entry: make check`
- [x] **HOOK-03**: Commit-msg hook validates conventional commit format via pre-commit — conventional-pre-commit@v4.3.0 on commit-msg stage
- [x] **HOOK-04**: Legacy `scripts/hooks/` bash scripts removed — directory deleted in commit 73cbcd0
- [x] **HOOK-05**: `make bootstrap` target updated to use `pre-commit install` instead of manual hook copying — legacy hook copying removed in commit 73cbcd0

## Future Requirements

Deferred to future milestones. Tracked but not in current roadmap.

### Code Generation (v0.3.0+)

- **GEN-01**: `architect generate` produces DAS scripts from source schemas (deterministic)
- **GEN-02**: `architect generate` produces DAR scripts from DAB output (deterministic)
- **GEN-03**: Demo scenario validation (e-commerce or similar)

## Out of Scope

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Custom hook scripts beyond make check | `make check` is single source of truth — no per-hook config |
| CI/CD changes | CI already runs `make check`, no changes needed |
| Additional linters not in current Makefile | Scope is migration, not adding new checks |

## Traceability

| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| HOOK-01 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| HOOK-02 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| HOOK-03 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| HOOK-04 | Phase 5 | Complete |
| HOOK-05 | Phase 5 | Complete |
