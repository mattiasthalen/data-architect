| HOOK-01: Pre-commit framework installed via `make bootstrap` | 5 | SATISFIED | Makefile line 11: `uv run pre-commit install` |
| HOOK-02: `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with local hook running `make check` | 5 | SATISFIED | Config line 10: `entry: make check` |
| HOOK-03: Commit-msg hook validates conventional commit format | 5 | SATISFIED | Config lines 16-20: conventional-pre-commit@v4.3.0 |
| HOOK-04: Legacy `scripts/hooks/` bash scripts removed | 5 | SATISFIED | Directory deleted in commit 73cbcd0 |
| HOOK-05: `make bootstrap` updated to use `pre-commit install` | 5 | SATISFIED | Makefile line 11, legacy hook copying removed |

## Phase Verification

| Phase | Status | Score | Artifacts | Anti-patterns |
|-------|--------|-------|-----------|---------------|
| 5. Pre-commit Framework Migration | human_needed (all automated checks passed) | 4/4 truths | 3/3 exist + substantive + wired | 0 found |

**Score: 1/1 phases verified**

## Cross-Phase Integration

| Connection | Source | Target | Status |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|
| make check → pre-commit | Makefile line 33 | .pre-commit-config.yaml line 10 | WIRED |
| pre-commit install → config | Makefile line 11 | .pre-commit-config.yaml | WIRED |
| dev deps → pre-commit | pyproject.toml line 45 | Makefile line 9 | WIRED |
| pre-commit → make check | .pre-commit-config.yaml line 10 | Makefile line 33 | WIRED |
| bootstrap → hooks | Makefile lines 9-11 | .git/hooks/ | WIRED |
| CI → make check | .github/workflows/ci.yml line 22 | Makefile line 33 | WIRED |

**Score: 6/6 connections wired**

## E2E Flows

| Flow | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| Bootstrap → Hook Installation | COMPLETE | `make bootstrap` installs pre-commit + commit-msg hooks |
| Commit → Pre-commit → make check | COMPLETE | Quality gate enforced on every commit |
| Commit message → Validation | COMPLETE | Conventional commit format enforced, invalid messages rejected |

**Score: 3/3 flows complete**

## Tech Debt

None accumulated. Phase 5 is a clean migration with no deferred items.

## Audit Conclusion

All requirements met. All cross-phase integrations verified. All E2E developer flows complete. No anti-patterns, no tech debt. Milestone is ready to ship.
